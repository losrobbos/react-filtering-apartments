# React Filtering

This is a demo showing how to apply FILTERING on Lists, using a combination of filter criteria:

- Text search (e.g. for city or country)
- Matching by OR (e.g. EITHER Apartment OR House)
- Matching by AND (e.g. WLAN + Seaview)

The demo uses React CONTEXT to store the data centrally to make it easy to share the FILTER data between components.
